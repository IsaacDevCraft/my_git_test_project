# Shining Light School Website Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Shining Light School Website Project! This project is a dynamic website created using HTML5, CSS3, and ES6 JavaScript to provide a modern and user-friendly online platform for Shining Light School. The website includes essential pages such as Home, About, Courses, and Contact to cater to the needs of students, parents, and staff members.

## Motivation
The goal of this project was to create a visually appealing and interactive website that reflects the ethos and values of Shining Light School. By incorporating the latest web technologies, my aim was to enhance the user experience and make information easily accessible to all visitors.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- ES6 JavaScript

## Features
- Home Page: Provides a welcoming introduction to the school
- About Page: Offers information about the school's Achievement,staffs/teams, and Entry Requirement.
- Courses Page: Lists the courses offered at the school with detailed descriptions
- Contact Page: Enables users to get in touch with the school through a responsive contact form

## Challenges and Solutions
Throughout the development process, I encountered challenges such as ensuring responsive design across different devices and optimizing website performance. By implementing media queries for responsiveness and optimizing code for efficiency, I successfully addressed these challenges.

## Next Steps
In the future, I plan to further enhance the website by adding features such as a blog section, event calendar, and student portal to create a more interactive and engaging online experience for the school community.
